# DS Composites theme
This subtheme is based off of Remora's base theme. An extended documentation is available [here](https://www.github.com/MRM-Remora/barrio_base_theme/tree/master/README.md)

## Gulp
Gulp is used to compile the SCSS to CSS, and run minifiers against the various asset files.  
All js and css assets are stored in build/js and build/css respectively.

### Usage
To compile, run the following command in the subtheme's directory: `npm install && gulp`
